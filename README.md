# Simple JavaScript Quiz Game

This is a small quiz project I made using basic JavaScript concepts like arrays, loops, prompt(), alert(), and functions.  
The quiz runs inside the browser and asks the user a few simple questions. After answering all of them, it shows the final score.

I built this project to practice:
- storing questions in an array
- using a loop to display each question
- taking input with prompt()
- checking answers using if-else
- using .toLowerCase() and .trim() for clean comparison
- keeping track of score
- showing feedback using alert()

Even though it’s a simple project, it helped me understand how user interaction works in JavaScript without using any HTML forms or buttons.

## How to Run the Quiz

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any browser (Chrome recommended).
3. Click the "Start Quiz" button.
4. Answer each question in the popup prompts.
5. At the end, your score will be displayed.

## Files Included

- **index.html** → Main HTML file with a styled quiz button and the script.
- **README.md** → Explanation of the project.
  
## Notes

This project was made for practice and learning purposes.  
It focuses only on core JavaScript (no frameworks, no DOM manipulation).
